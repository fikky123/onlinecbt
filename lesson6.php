		<h3><i>A plan a day, keeps a bad day away!</i></h3>
		<p align="justify">You might feel that written plan is such an old-fashionable way. However, this is
						   one of the way that could brighten your way. With written down your plan of what to 
						   do on your every day, could make you feel proud than you could ever imagine! When
						   you look back on your activity plan, you could see that the thoughts of 'oh i did
						   this the other day. that's mean i can do this again!'. In addition, by writing them down,
						   help you to face your problem and not avoiding them anymore.</p>
		<p>These are ways to keep your activity plan:</p>
		<ol><li align="justify">Buy an aesthetic/preferences book or journal or you could use any of unused notebook. Or you can download activity plan's
				template on the internet and use them.</li>
		    <li align="justify">Write down what you are planning to do in a day or in a week. Try to plan doing an easy task at first. 
				Maybe with writing doing chores at home first, or try to say hi to your friends. You don't have to burden
				yourself by  writing fancies stuff. Instead, focus on your ownself. Slowly but persistently to get better.</li>
			<li align="justify">You can reward yourself by doing anything you like once you are done with the-day activity plan. It could because
				by reading books or listening to a good music or watching tvs.</li>
		</ol>
		<hr class="w3-clear" id="journals">
		<h3><i>Daily Journals</i></h3>
		<p align="justify">Now, you will keep the daily journal. Writing the journal will take a few minutes every day.
						   This will help you realize that there isn't only about sorrow moment in your life but beautiful moment as well.
						   Making daily journal may be taking times for you to make is as habit. This is why you need to know why you need daily journals.
						   Is it because you want to get better? or is it because you want to see your progress through these journals? you know yourself more
						   than us.</p>
		<p align="justify">Since we are making a daily journals, instead of rambling about something, you may want to write things that you are grateful that day,
						   how do you want to feel and what will i do in order  to feel that emotions in the morning. For example, you may write 'today i feel grateful to be alive,
						   to be breathe again and to see beautiful view in the morning. I want to feel nice; having a cup of coffee while reading books at the couch
						   without doing anything.' In addition, don't forget to write your affirmation. For example, write down 'today affirmation would be me being
						   confident and wore whatever I want' or 'I have studied, I will do my best today'.</p>
		<p align="justify">Then, in the evening, write great things that happened today and what could I have done to make tomorrow a better day? These questions will let you grow
							as time goes by. You don't have to write a vague things, instead write something that could make you feel better. For instance, you fell on the bicycle and
							you are ashamed because everyone in the park saw you. But what could you do in order to make it better? You might want to pedalling the bicycle slowly and be
							more careful in the future so you won't fall again.</p>
